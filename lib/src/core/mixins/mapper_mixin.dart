/// A mixin that provides methods for converting between different representations of data.
///
/// The [MapperEntity] mixin is used to define the conversion between a model and an entity.
/// It includes methods for converting a model to an entity and for converting an entity back
/// to a model.
///
/// This mixin can be applied to classes where you need to transform data between different formats,
/// such as between domain entities and data models.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// class UserModel {
///   final String userId;
///   final String userName;
///   final String userEmail;
///
///   UserModel({
///     required this.userId,
///     required this.userName,
///     required this.userEmail,
///   });
/// }
///
/// class UserEntity {
///   final String id;
///   final String name;
///   final String email;
///
///   UserEntity({
///     required this.id,
///     required this.name,
///     required this.email,
///   });
/// }
///
/// class UserMapper with MapperEntity<UserEntity, UserModel> {
///   final UserModel userModel;
///
///   UserMapper(this.userModel);
///
///   @override
///   UserEntity toEntity() {
///     return UserEntity(
///       id: userModel.userId,
///       name: userModel.userName,
///       email: userModel.userEmail,
///     );
///   }
///
///   @override
///   UserModel fromEntity(UserEntity entity) {
///     return UserModel(
///       userId: entity.id,
///       userName: entity.name,
///       userEmail: entity.email,
///     );
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The [toEntity] method converts the model instance to an entity instance.
/// The [fromEntity] method converts an entity instance back to a model instance.
mixin MapperEntity<T, F> {
  /// Converts the current instance to an entity of type [F].
  ///
  /// This method should be implemented to provide the logic for converting
  /// a model instance to an entity instance.
  F toEntity();

  /// Converts an entity of type [F] back to a model of type [T].
  ///
  /// should override this method to provide the logic for converting an
  /// entity instance back to a model instance.
  // T fromEntity(F model);
}
